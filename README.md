# ~~aaa~~
###### at first, i think it should be loaded as the first mod, so it's named aaa.

# CelesteHookCollisionDetectionHelper
modify monomod should be better, but i can't build it for some reason.

so it eventually becomes a helper.

---

i am sure it is just a helper. it can't check if the collision actually happened. i should still comfirm it manually.

## Usage
it's a monocle command (`GetHookCollision`). No parameters. Just wait, attach debugger, and collect data from `aaaModule.Difference`.
